TCX is authentication module to secure API Server.

It's adapt OAuth2 scheme, but it use more simplify scheme which provide authentication for client-server without need to define scopes.

1. Authentication Type, TCX support three ways authentication type:
    - One Way Transaction Code (OWTC): Client only need to use "app_id" and "app_public" to access Server APIs.
    - Two Way Transaction Code (TWTC): Client has to use "app_id" and "app_public" to get access token, then it can be used to access APIs.
    - Free Transaction Code (FTC): Client use master token to access APIs, without need to request token for every requests. You need to
      generate Master token manually.

    To specify authentication for each APIs assign parameter in the middleware, use 'or' (|) sign to specify multiple authentication or use
    'all' to support all type (Supported type : 'all', 'owtc', 'twtc', 'ftc'). By default, TCX will support all authentication if you didn't
    specifying supported type.

    Client need to specify type by sending "X-TCX-TYPE" header in every APIs request.

2. Authorization Routes, TCX provide some routes which is can be used to get access token in TWTC type:
    - '/tcx/authorize':
        -- METHOD: POST
        -- Params:
            --- app_id: Client application id.
            --- app_pass: Client password, it can be generate by hashing plain of joined server master token, application public key,
                and client dynamic token with SHA1. Client need to append the given dynamic token to hash result by splitting with colon (:)
                symbol, then encrypt it with base64.
    - '/tcx/reauthorize':
        -- METHOD: POST
        -- Params:
            --- app_id: Client application id.
            --- token: Refresh Token, it's provided when Client authorizing to server, but you need to encrypt it with base64.

3. Authentication Headers.
    - Type 'OWTC':
        -- 'X-TCX-TYPE': 'OWTC'.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-ID': Client ID.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-PASS': Client Password.
    - Type 'TWTC':
        -- 'X-TCX-TYPE': 'TWTC'.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-ID': Client ID.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-PASS': Client Password.
        -- 'X-TCX-TOKEN': Access Token, obtained by doing authorization.
    - Type 'OWTC':
        -- 'X-TCX-TYPE': 'FTC'.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-ID': Client ID.
        -- 'X-TCX-APP-PASS': Client Password.
        -- 'X-TCX-TOKEN': Master Access Token.
